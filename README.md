# React useEffect Demonstration Project

Welcome to the demonstration project for Sigma School's React lesson, focusing specifically on the use of React's `useEffect` hook. This educational tool is designed to showcase how `useEffect` can be leveraged to perform side effects in your components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in React applications.

## About This Project

This project provides a practical example to help students understand and implement React's `useEffect` hook. By exploring this project, students will gain insights into how `useEffect` works and how it can be used to enhance functionality and user experience in a React application. The project uses the https://sg-bus-arrivals-sigma-schoolsc1.replit.app/?id=${id} to fetch real-time bus arrival data, which demonstrates effective use of `useEffect` for API calls.

## Live Demo

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, students will learn:
- How to use the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects in React components.
- Techniques for fetching data and updating the state upon component mounting and updates.
- Best practices for cleaning up effects to prevent memory leaks.
